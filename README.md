# Rocket-Turbofan-Axial-Turbine-Generation
This program (Rocket-TATG) is code which generates the optimal 3D blade shape, twist, and sizing for a rocket engines axial turbine. This one specifically is designed for a two stage turbine. This tool includes rapid blade generation, 3D visualisation, with inputs of required temperatures, efficiencies, aerofoil geometries and rotational velocity.
